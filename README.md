# IBM SPSS Modeler workshop - from zero to hero

**Objective**

The objective of this workshop is to build a working machine learning (ML) model in 30 minutes without coding using IBM SPSS Modeler. Youâ€™ll build a model that will help to predict the customer churn (customers leaving the company) for a telecommunications company (telco). 


In order to run this workshop you must have IBM SPSS Modeler intalled on your computer (PC or Mac). If you don't have a copy of IBM SPSS Modeler, check below 

**Obtaining a copy of IBM SPSS Modeler**
1. Get a 30 day free IBM SPSS Modeler trial version from the [IBM website](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-19947) - via IBM Watson Studio Desktop trial
